# AV3ToggleUtil

A small utility to quickly create GameObject & Component toggles for VRChat SDK 3.0 Avatars.  
The tool adds all the necessary parameters to both the `VRCExpressionParameters` and FXLayer that already exist on the avatar. It also creates the animations & a new layer in the FXLayer with the correct states and transitions. A Toggle for the property will also be added to the selected `VRCExpressionsMenu`.

## How to use

Right click GameObject to toggle > Create AV3 Toggle > Click Create button
